# DFESW11_Garage
## Garage
1. Using Vehicle as a base class, create three derived classes (Car, Motorbike, etc.). Each derived class should have its own attributes in addition to the normal Vehicle attributes.
2. Using a List<> implementation, store all your Vehicles in a Garage class.
3. Create a method in Garage that iterates through each Vehicle, calculating a bill for each type of Vehicle in a different way, depending on the type of Vehicle it is (this does not need to be complex).
4. Garage should have methods that add a Vehicle, remove a Vehicle by its ID or its type, fix a Vehicle (which calculates the bill) and to empty the Garage.
5. Garage should have a method to remove multiple Vehicles by their type.
